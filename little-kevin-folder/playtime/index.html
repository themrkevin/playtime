                        <p>“As a former elementary teacher, I've had lots of professional development and my experience with Integrative Nutrition ranked at the top. The health information I learned, along with the business skills and the customer service allowed me to partner with a holistic pediatrician to start the successful business NourishMD.com. I also coach parents locally, helping them to change their family's diet. I love what I do.”</p>
